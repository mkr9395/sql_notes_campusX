    "1. **InnoDB**:\n",
    "   InnoDB is the default and most widely used storage engine in MySQL. It provides ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) compliance and supports features like transactions, foreign keys, and row-level locking. It's a good choice for applications requiring high reliability, concurrency, and data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **MyISAM**:\n",
    "   MyISAM is another storage engine that was widely used in older versions of MySQL. It offers high performance for read-heavy workloads but lacks support for transactions and foreign keys. MyISAM tables are more suitable for scenarios where data is mostly read and write operations are infrequent.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **MEMORY (HEAP)**:\n",
    "   The MEMORY storage engine, also known as HEAP, stores data in memory, which makes it extremely fast for read and write operations. However, it's not suitable for large datasets or persistent storage, as data is lost when the MySQL server restarts. It's often used for caching and temporary data storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Archive**:\n",
    "   The Archive storage engine is optimized for storing large amounts of data with minimal storage space. It achieves this by compressing data, but it does not support indexing or updating individual rows. It's a good choice for historical or log data that is primarily inserted and rarely accessed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **NDB (Cluster)**:\n",
    "   The NDB storage engine, also known as MySQL Cluster, is designed for high availability and real-time performance. It's suitable for applications that require distributed, fault-tolerant storage with low-latency access. NDB uses shared-nothing architecture and can provide high scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **CSV**:\n",
    "   The CSV storage engine stores data in plain-text CSV (Comma-Separated Values) format. It's useful for importing and exporting data between different systems. However, it lacks features like indexing and is generally not suitable for complex queries or high-performance applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **BLACKHOLE**:\n",
    "   The BLACKHOLE storage engine discards any data written to it, making it useful for replication setups where you want to replicate data changes to other servers without storing the actual data locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Federated**:\n",
    "   The Federated storage engine enables you to create tables that map to tables in remote MySQL servers. It's helpful for distributed systems and data integration, allowing you to query remote data seamlessly."
